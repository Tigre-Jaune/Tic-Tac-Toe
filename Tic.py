        Tic Tac Toe - Rules of the Game
        1-The game is played on a 3 by 3 grid.
        2-Two players take turns. One player uses X and the other player uses O.
        3-Players take turns placing their mark (X or O) in an empty square.
        4-A square cannot be used more than once.
        5-The first player to get three of their marks in a row wins. The row can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal.
        6-If all nine squares are filled and no player has three in a row, the game ends in a draw.
          
        you should play for the player 'X' and I will give you a
        set with every row of the tic tac toe and I want you to tell me where should I play next? 
        this is the set: {game}.
        
        you answer should only include the place of the next move
        I emphasize that you should only say the place of the next move without even saying any word,
        just a place that consist of the number of the row and the number of the column (for example:(2,1))
